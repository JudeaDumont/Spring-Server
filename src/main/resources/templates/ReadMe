This Templates Directory is used by thymeleaf to provide the server with a context in which
HTML will be parsed for particular entities that need to be replaced with serverside knowledge

For example, the server knows what the CSRF Token information is,
This information can be embedded in the page that is served to the client upon request,
but SHOULD NOT be sent to the client or retrievable client side in general.
