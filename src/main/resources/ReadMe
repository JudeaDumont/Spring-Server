The spring server will look here for application properties.
In the application properties you will find magical configuration settings that are all interpreted
spring side.

There are tricks such that how those configurations are interpreted can be changed.

The way that works is by referencing a class in the spring context directory that extends said configclass,
and overriding the methods that would handle said configuration specifically,

Spring is set to handle itself with default implementation.

So when things break, it is not obvious that they are broken unless you know what the default behaviour looks like.
Or if the intended behaviour is known well enough.
