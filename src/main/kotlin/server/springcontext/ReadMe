The spring server files cannot be split into different packages
without making sure that every dependency for the spring server file is referenced elsewhere.

To separate any file from being in the same package outside of where the application file is,
there must be additional dependency reference.

Essentially every file that is used by the spring server must be treated as a configuration file that
the spring server cannot run without referencing a dependency to that file in the application context.

The modules themselves should know the name of their configurations

A client could still be interested in a module even though the module isnt loaded

There is a notion of modules being staged

//App module constructor takes a callback that gets called when the app process raw data into high level properties
//App module is not passed raw properties, it knows the channel for which its raw properties come in to be processed into the app specific module
//Delta Engine needs to be a generic class that anything can use
//delta engine goes inside each app module, deltas on raw props, and on computed props that go out
